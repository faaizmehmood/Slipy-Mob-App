# Slipy-Mob-App
About The app integrated with APIs, and worked on graphs. I used Express.js with MongoDB to create methods, applied queries with lookups and pipelines, and uploaded images to Google Cloud Storage using Express.js with multer. I also added features like a scanner, shopping list, manual expense tracker, and deals to make the app a stand-alone app.
